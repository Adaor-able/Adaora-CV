# Adaora-CV


## Description

This project was created with several goals in mind:

To make a responsive webpage for my CV and work profile with interactive elements, in order to host a growing portfolio of work and present myself as a prospective employee with personal creativity.

Another important goal was to make the code of the webpage accessible, semantic, DRY and readable.


## Usage

To use this webpage, click any of the items in the navigation bar menu in the top right-hand corner of the page (as shown in the screenshot below). Each menu item will take you to different sections of my profile with links to each of my projects found in the 'Work' section.

To view the code of the webpage to make any changes or to review the code:

From a Windows computer: right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect Element or from the toolbar menu select Tools > Web Developer > Inspector from the top menu bar.

From a computer using mac OS: right-click anywhere on the page and choose “Inspect” from the options or on your keyboard press: Option+Command+I as a shortcut.
